Personal portfolio project with HTML and CSS.

Demonstrates some recent pages made with HTML and CSS.

Tested with JS under freecodecamp.org parameters

Working link available at: href="link-here"




CURRENT VERSION:

Bare bones HTML fulfilling all CONTENT testing criteria




TO DO:

Visual design - link in CSS style sheet

Projects as 2 rows of three columns - grid/flexbox

Reconfigure git repository and 'git pages' so I can display individual projects (fix 404 error)

Add Media query

The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.

The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
